## Project Description

Interprocess Communication App: This repository contains a client-server application for communication between processes using named pipes and TCP/IP sockets. The client generates a random number and sends it to the server, which responds with a that number of random numbers. The project includes backend code in C and a frontend interface in Python, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction. Explore the code and learn about interprocess communication techniques and random number generation.

### Project Architecture :

Before going into the application, we need to understand correctly the architecture that the developer adapted to build his project & what are the tools needed, which is in this case:

First we have the Back end named pipe architecture :

Then we will discover the Socket Backend architecture:
